                    <li>1/2 pound mussels (about 12, cooked and shucked)</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese (plus more for serving)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley</li>

                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Put the seafood stock in a saucepan and bring to a low simmer. Keep warm.</li>
                <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan or saut√© pan over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are softened.</li>

When the rice is al dente and creamy, taste and then add the lemon zest (if using) and season with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
                <li>Add the scallops and shrimp to the rice mixture. Continue to cook for about 5 minutes, or until the seafood is cooked. Add the cooked mussels, Parmesan cheese, the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter, and parsley. Cook, stirring, until hot.</li>
