# odin-recipes

In this project we created an recipe web-page. On main or index page there are 3 links which are linking to different recipe pages. On each recipe page there is a title of the recipe, description, ingrients needed for the recipe and steps how to make a dish on a recipe. Ingridiants are in an unordered list meanwhile Steps are in the ordered list.
